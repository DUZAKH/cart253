# 9Luck

mini project about black cats and lucky and unlucky omens...

This game conceptually focuses on the everlasting presence of death, no matter what the player/viewers do they end up dying. I wanted to incorporate omens, symbolism, and pathetic fallacy as it is a superstitious and mystical presence in my own psyche. Within the context of this game, I ended up using common lucky/unlucky symbols and omens from different cultures.

The point of this was to ensure that no player is aware of what every single symbol means. 

Ladybug and itchy feet, Iran.
Wheel and owl, Rome.
Chopsticks In rice and fish, China.
Horseshoe, North America.
Clover and mirror, Western Europe.
