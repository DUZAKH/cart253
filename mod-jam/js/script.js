 * You will die regardless of what you do, but is there larger meaning in this death?
 * In you?
 * In your surroundings?
 * Play to find out how it all ends..
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * - Black Cat will be following your mouse
 * - Click to launch her paw
 * - Catch lucky items to survive longer 
 * - If you catch unlucky items, you will lose your 9 lucky hearts
 * - If you do not catch them they will collide with the wall and make you lose lives anyways..
 * - act quickly and see how long you last!
